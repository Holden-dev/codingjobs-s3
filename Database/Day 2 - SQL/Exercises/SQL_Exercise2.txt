-- Explanation :

Now, there is a 'novels' table that has the same fields as the 'books' table.
For this exercises, use union command (cf union.sql file or check this link : https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_union.asp).

-- Queries :
	- Retrieve all novels and all books in one query.
	SELECT * FROM books
	UNION
	SELECT * FROM novels;

	- Collect all novels and all books from/since 2018
	SELECT * FROM books WHERE publication_date >= '2018/01/01'
	UNION
	SELECT * FROM novels WHERE publication_date >= '2018/01/01';

	- Get the total price per author (books and novels combined).

	SELECT table1.author_id, SUM(table1.price)
	FROM (SELECT author_id, price
	FROM books
	UNION ALL
	SELECT author_id, price
	FROM novels) table1
	GROUP BY table1.author_id


	- Get the total price for all books AND all novels (books and novels seperated).

	SELECT 'books' as Origin, SUM(price) as Total
	FROM books
	UNION
	SELECT 'novels' as Origin, SUM(price) as Total
	FROM novels
