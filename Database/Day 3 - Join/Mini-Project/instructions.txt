We want to develop a dynamic web application of the type 'Spotify'.

Here is all the information and all the needs necessary for the development of the
database.

Structure:

A music is designated by a title, a release date, an artist and a category.
An artist is designated by name, biography, year of birth and gender.
Example of possible music category: Pop / Rock / Rap / Funkâ€¦.
A user is designated by a name, a first name, an email and a password.
A playlist is designated by a title, a creation date, a user (the one who owns
the playlist) and all of the music in this playlist.

Create the DB design !
