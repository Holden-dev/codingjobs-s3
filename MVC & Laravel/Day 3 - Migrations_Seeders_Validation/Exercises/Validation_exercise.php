Get back to our Flower Exercise.

You should improve your project using validations ! 

Resource : https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation

Step 1 :

    When the form to create new flower is submitted, you have to check :
        - name is required, min 3 characters and max 30 characters
        - price is required and have to be numeric between 2 and 100€
    
    Error messages should be display in red on the page;
    
    Implements validations on the EDIT form also.



Step 2 - Bonus :

    You should customize the error message.
    If the name is empty, you should display 'Name is mandatory !'
    If the price is not a numeric value OR is not between 2 and 100 it should display 'Price must be numeric between 2 and 100e'

    For this step, you have to read this section : https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation#customizing-the-error-messages
