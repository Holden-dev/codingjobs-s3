	Using the Animal/Robot/Human exercise.

	- Step 1 :
		Think about the nature of your classes. At least one of them will never be instantiate...
		You need to turn them into abstract class.
		Maybe change some methods to make it abstract methods.
		
		Tips : If you pay attention, many of our classes can 'talk' or 'make a sound'

	- Step 2 :

		In a main program (client) :

		1. Create an array of animals and humans (cats, dogs or humans)
		2. Create a script where :
			- Loop through the array
			- Each time the current element should make a sound
