<?php 

/*

    Create a Utility class.

    This class will be used to display a Log message like this one : '2021-04-26 14:00:03 - Accessing file';

    Create a static function in the class to match the instructions.
    Everytime this method is called, you will append the log in a file (dont overwrite it).
  
  	You should be able to call this method anytime, without instanciate the class.

    Create a client.php. Each time you're going to 'client.php', it should save log in the file.
