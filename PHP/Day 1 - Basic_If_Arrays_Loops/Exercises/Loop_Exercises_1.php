-- Character Exercise

We will continue the 'Character' exercise.

Instead of attack and defense point variables, you need to replace those with an array :
        -- An array of characteristics (attak point, defense point... put anything you want)
        Use an associative array.

You have to use a loop to display all the characteristics now !
