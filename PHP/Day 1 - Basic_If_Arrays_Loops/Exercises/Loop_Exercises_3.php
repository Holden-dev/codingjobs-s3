	- Exercise 1 :
		
		Write a PHP script which displays this pattern : 
			* 
			* * 
			* * * 
			* * * * 
			* * * * * 

		You have to use a loop inside another loop to do this !

		If you're stuck on this one, you probably can find solution online. Try to understand it.

	- Final exercise - ONLY FOR THE BEASTS - BONUS

		We have an array of integers, unsorted, with all numbers from 1 to 50 BUT one element is missing (the array therefore contains 49 elements).
		
		The goal is to find the missing item (the missing number).
		However, you have 3 constraints:
		- You can use as many loops as you want BUT you have the right to iterate/loop the array only once!
		- You have the right to use only one variable !
		- You can use only one function : count()

		An example with an array with 9 elements :

			$array = array(5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 6 ,8, 4, 10);
	        // Missing number is 7

	        $var = ...

	        for (int i = 0; i < count($array); ++i)
	        {
	            ...
	        }

	        echo "Missing number is: " . $var;
