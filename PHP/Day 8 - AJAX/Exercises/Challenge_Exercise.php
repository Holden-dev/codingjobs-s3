/*

We have an array of integers, positive, between 1 and $nbElements (nbElements is the number of elements. You can use this variable).

$array = [5, 2, 3, 6, 7];
$nbElements = count($array);

Examples :

	Write a function call 'FizzBuzz'.
	For each number of the list, we want the following operations:
		. if the number is divisible by 3 : display 'Fizz'
		. if the number is divisible by 5 : display 'Buzz'
		. if the number is divisible by 3 AND by 5 : display 'TicTac'
		. else : display the number itself
