/*
    Javascript is able to connect to a web server, read pages, make an HTTP request thanks to AJAX.

    AJAX = Asynchronous Javascript And XML
    AJAX is not a language, it's a process/method.
    It allows, in our example, to get results from a PHP page and update the browser without refreshing the page.
